# jellyfish-challenge

The Jellyfish tank can be modelled by a rectangular grid around which Jellyfish are able to move according to instructions provided from the Tank IR Remote Control. You are to write a program that determines each sequence of Jellyfish positions and reports the final position of the Jellyfish. A Jellyfish position consists of a grid coordinate (a pair of integers: x-coordinate followed by y-coordinate) and an orientation (N, S, E, W for north, south, east, and west).

A Jellyfish instruction is a string of the letters â€œLâ€?, â€œRâ€?, and â€œFâ€? which represent, respectively, the instructions:

 - Left : the jellyfish turns left 90 degrees and remains on the current grid point.
 - Right : the jellyfish turns right 90 degrees and remains on the current grid point.
 - Forward : the jellyfish moves forward one grid point in the direction of the current orientation and maintains the same orientation.

The direction North corresponds to the direction from grid point (x, y) to grid point (x, y+1). There is also a possibility that additional command types may be required in the future and provision should be made for this.

Since the grid is rectangular and bounded (...yes the Jellyfish tank is a very flat tank), a jellyfish that moves â€œoffâ€? the edge of the grid is lost forever. However, lost jellyfish leave a jellyfish â€œscentâ€? that prohibits future jellyfish from dropping off the tank at the same grid point. The scent is left at the last grid position the jellyfish occupied before disappearing over the edge. An instruction to move â€œoffâ€? the tank from a grid point from which a jellyfish has been previously lost is simply ignored by the current jellyfish.

## The Input

The first line of input is the upper-right coordinates of the rectangular tank, the lower-left coordinates are assumed to be 0, 0. The remaining input consists of a sequence of jellyfish positions and instructions (two lines per jellyfish). A position consists of two integers specifying the initial coordinates of the jellyfish and an orientation (N, S, E, W), all separated by whitespace on one line. A jellyfish instruction is a string of the letters â€œLâ€?, â€œRâ€?, and â€œFâ€? on one line.

Each jellyfish is processed sequentially, i.e., finishes executing the jellyfish instructions before the next jellyfish begins execution. The maximum value for any coordinate is 60. All instruction strings will be less than 100 characters in length.

## The Output

For each jellyfish position/instruction in the input, the output should indicate the final grid position and orientation of the jellyfish. If a jellyfish falls off the edge of the grid the word â€œLOSTâ€? should be printed after the position and orientation.

## Guidelines

For submissions:

- Use the F# programming language.
- There's no official time limit for this test.
- Your goal should be code thats concise but readable and easy for someone new to understand.
